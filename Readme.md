Hello there ðŸ‘‹ <br/>
Welcome to my Scraper code repo. <br/>

Scrapper is a mini web platform that let you upload a CSV file with the keywords inside, and use that CSV file to scrape on Google to give analytics on search result.

Here is a sample format of the CSV file (each keyword is line-separated):
```csv
macbook air m2
laptop
iphone
iphone 15 pink
```
